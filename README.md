# vimmodules

This repository contains some vim modules that help me using it. Feel free to use them as you wish.

This function asks you for a number of rows and columns and creates a basic AsciiDoc table. The table is accessible through the " register, so you can put it into the text by pressing "p" or "P" in Normal mode.
